            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal education plays a central role in modern civilization. But in primitive cultures, most of the education happens not on the formal but on the informal level.This usually means that there is no distinction between activities focused on education and other activities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the whole environment may be seen as a form of school and many or all adults may act as teachers. An important reason for moving to formal forms of education is due to the sheer quantity of knowledge to be passed on, which requires both a formal setting and well-trained teachers to be transmitted effectively. A side effect of the process of formalization is that the educational experience becomes more abstract and more removed from daily life. In this regard, more emphasis is put on grasping general patterns instead of observing and imitating particular behavior.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal education.</p>
